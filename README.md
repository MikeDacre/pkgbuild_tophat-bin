# pkgbuild_tophat-bin
Arch Linux PKGBUILD for tophat-bin

This is the repository for the package provided here: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tophat-bin/

It exists just because the source version sometimes fails to compile on modern systems. I will delete it
when the source version routinely compiles on all of my machines for a period of 6 months.

Please note issues here, for out-of-date notifications, use the AUR page.
